This script is designed to solve the Stochastic University Course TImetabling Problem

Problem description:
There is a set of courses that must be taught within 
a timeframework usually 1 week.

There is also a set of professor who has availability 
and skills to teach a subset of objects that

Besides, the demand of each course is assumed stochastic
following a given probability distribution

The objective function is to minimize the cost of
assigning professor to subjects as well as a penalazation
cost, associated to leave student out of a lesson in a given timeslot

The problem is solved directly using cplex solver, but we also implement the
the GAPM (Generalized adaptive partition method) 
developed by Ramirez-Pico and Moreno
